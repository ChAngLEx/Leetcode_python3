A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
























思路：
1. 九章
分四种情况分析：m在peak处；m在下坡处，即左侧一定有peak；m在上坡处，即右侧一定有peak；m在坡底

2. 简易版
因为题目要求any one of the peaks，因此可将整体看作一个坡，求其peak
