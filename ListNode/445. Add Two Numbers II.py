You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Follow up:
What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.

Example:

Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7


先转换为数字,相加后,转换为str,然后一个一个的放入dummy

code:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = tail = ListNode(None)
        
        num1, num2 = 0, 0
        while l1:
            num1 = num1 * 10 + l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        while l2:
            num2 = num2 * 10 + l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        
        res = num1 + num2
        str_res = str(res)
        for num in str_res:
            tail.next = ListNode(int(num))
            tail = tail.next
        
        return dummy.next
